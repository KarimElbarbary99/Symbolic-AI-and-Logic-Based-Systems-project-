### ðŸš† Problem Description

This subproject involves finding the most efficient train connection between two stations using a real-world railway dataset. The dataset is derived from Indian Railways and includes train schedules, arrival/departure times, and distances for thousands of connections.

The core challenge is to model the data as a graph and implement **Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm** to compute the optimal path based on different cost functions. Each path must be formatted according to a structured specification and satisfy constraints like train transfer times and day-overflow in arrival/departure hours.

Each connection problem specifies:
- A **start station** and **end station**
- A **schedule file** (full or mini version)
- A **cost function** that defines the optimization objective

Supported cost functions include:
- `stops`: Number of intermediate stops entered
- `distance`: Total kilometers traveled
- `price`: Number of train tickets required (based on train switches and midnight cutoffs)
- `arrivaltime HH:MM:SS`: Total travel time, accounting for realistic train switch constraints

For each connection, the system computes a valid route and outputs a structured plan (e.g., `12345 : 10 -> 15 ; 54321 : 5 -> 9`) along with the total cost.

## Introduction

The primary purpose of this script is to address the challenges associated with optimizing train journeys in a network of interconnected stations. By leveraging Dijkstra's algorithm, the script identifies the most efficient routes based on different criteria, offering valuable insights into the intricacies of train schedules.

### Key Features 
- **Dynamic Cost Functions:** The script supports multiple cost functions, allowing users to customize the optimization criteria based on their specific requirements. Whether prioritizing minimal stops, shortest distance, cost-effective pricing, or efficient arrival times, the script adapts accordingly.
- **Comprehensive Graph Representation:** The train schedule is represented as a weighted directed graph, where stations serve as nodes, and the edges between these nodes carry diffrent labels such as: train number, arrival and departure times, station numbers, and various cost functions as weights. This comprehensive representation enables a detailed analysis of the entire train network.
- **Efficient Path Exploration:** Dijkstra's algorithm, a widely used algorithm for finding the shortest paths in weighted graphs, is employed to ensure efficient and accurate exploration of potential routes. The priority queue implementation further enhances the speed of path discovery.
- **Input Flexibility:** The script seamlessly integrates with CSV files containing train schedule data. This allows users to apply the algorithm to different scenarios by providing their own datasets.

## Setup
### This repository contains:
 1) **`Find_best_train_connection.py`**: That contains the implementation for solving the train connection problem. It includes functions for reading train schedule data from CSV files, applying Dijkstra's algorithm with various cost functions, and writing the results to a CSV file.
 2) **`schedule.csv`**: The dataset file

### How to run the code: 

1. Import pandas as pd, import heapq, from datetime import datetime.
2. **problem.csv** and **`Find_best_train_connection.py`** must be in the same folder.
3. The dataset must be placed inside a folder named 'assignment', both the folder and the file **`Find_best_train_connection.py`** must be in the same folder.
4. Run **`Find_best_train_connection.py`**.
### Used libraries:

**_heapq:_**
Description: The heapq library in Python provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm, which is a priority queue algorithm. It is used for efficiently maintaining a priority queue, allowing for quick retrieval of the smallest element.
Purpose in Code: In the script, heapq is utilized to manage a priority queue during the execution of Dijkstra's algorithm. This enables the efficient exploration of potential paths in the weighted graph.

**_pandas:_**
Description: pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It provides data structures like DataFrame for efficient handling and analysis of structured data.
Purpose in Code: The script employs pandas to read and process data from CSV files containing train schedule information. It simplifies the manipulation of tabular data, making it easier to extract relevant details for further analysis.

**_datetime:_**
Description: The datetime module is part of the Python standard library and provides classes for working with dates and times.
Purpose in Code: In the script, datetime is used to handle and manipulate time-related information. It aids in calculating time differences, parsing time strings, and performing operations related to arrival and departure times in the train schedule.
## Code Structure
1) **Library imports**
```python
import heapq
import pandas as pd 
from datetime import datetime
```


2) **Parsing CSV input**
```python
# INPUT: mini-schedule.csv or schedule.csv
# OUTPUT: adjust lists used to create the data dictionary 
def readCSV(csvName):
    # ...
```
- **_First_**, The readCSV function parses the CSV file whose name is passed to it as an argument 'csvPath', and assigns it into a Pandas DataFrame called 'csv'.

- **_Second_**, It iterates over each row in the CSV file, extracting the contents of each column in the CSV input file and appending them to diffrenet lists.

- **_Third_**, It finds distinct trains using 
```python
# Iterate over the trains 'lst' fetched from the CSV file and extracts the distinct trains
def find_distinct_elements(lst):
    # ...
```
- **_Fourth_**, based on the previous generated lists, it creates new lists containing all possible information for each single train,  such as its 'arrival time', 'departure time', 'source stations', 'target stations', etc.. .

- **_Finally_**, the function returns a tuple containing various lists that have been adjusted based on the information extracted from the CSV file. 

3) **Time Manipulation Functions**
```python
def time_diff_in_minutes(time1, time2):
    # ...
```
This function calculates the time difference in minutes between two time strings in the format '%H:%M:%S', converts them to datetime objects, and return the diffrence in minutes
```python
def add_times(time_str1, time_str2_minutes):
    # ...
```
This function takes a time string (time_str1) _which in our scenario is the givenArrivalTime in the CSV file for the arrivaltime Cost function problems_, and a duration in minutes (time_str2_minutes) and adds them together in order to find the time spended since the arrival to the train station till the first train departure. 

4) **Dijkstra Algorithm**
```python
def dijkstra_shortest_path(data, start, end, costFunction, givenArrivalTime):
    # ...
```
- **Graph Initialization:**
The graph dictionary is initialized to represent the adjacency list of the graph. It is constructed from the input data, which includes source (src), target (tgt), weight (wt), train number (train_num), source sequence (src_elem), target sequence (tar_elem), arrival and departure times at the start and end stations.

- **Priority Queue Initialization:**
The priority_queue is a min-heap containing tuples with the format (current_cost, current_node, path, train_numbers, src_seq_list, tar_seq_list, last_train_number, lastArrivalBeforeTrainChange, lastDepartureBeforeTrainChange). It starts with a single entry representing the start node with cost 0.

- **Main Loop:**
The function enters a loop that continues until the priority queue is empty.
In each iteration, it pops the node with the lowest cost from the priority queue.
The function checks if the node has been visited before based on the combination of the current node and the last train number. If not, it adds the node to the visited set and continues.

- **Neighbor Exploration:**
For each neighbor of the current node, it calculates the new cost based on the chosen cost function (costFunction). The cost is updated according to the specified conditions for different cost functions.
The neighbor is pushed into the priority queue with the updated cost and other relevant information.

- **Termination and Result:**
If the current node is equal to the destination node (end), the function returns the path, cost, and other relevant information.
If the priority queue becomes empty and the destination is not reached, the function returns None.

- **Cost Functions:**
The function supports different cost functions such as 'stops', 'distance', 'price' and 'arrivaltime'. The cost is updated accordingly based on the chosen cost function.

## Self Evaluation and Design Decisions
- On the creation of the graph we focused on assigning to each distinct train the values associated to it such as 'source station', 'end station', 'arrival time' and 'departure time' on both start station and end station, etc. and passing those givings to a dictioniry.
- Within the dijkstra function we use the `zip()` function and pass to it the values of the previously created dictionary
```python
zip(data['source'], data['target'], data['weight'], data['train_number'], data['src_seq'], data['tar_seq'], data['arrivalTime_start'], data['departureTime_start'], data['arrivalTime_end'], data['departureTime_end'])
    # ...
```
resulting the following form: 
```python
# SGRL is the current station (islno 1)
# Next station is OBR (islno 2)
# Train 13346 is used to connect between those two adjacent stations
# The train arrives at station SGRL at '00:00:00' and departs from it at '05:45:00'
# Then the train arrives at station OBR at '07:09:00' and departs from it at '07:10:00'
['SGRL' : ('OBR', 0, "'13346'", 1, 2, "'00:00:00'", "'05:45:00'", "'07:09:00'", "'07:10:00'")]
```
- When applying the dijkstra function we encountere a small problem, that the algorithm neglets the shared stations such as 'BSB' if it was visited only once by ANY train when traversing for the solution to find the shortest path available to reach the Goal station; since, when the station is visited the function immediately adds it to the 'visited' list neglecting that the station can also be visited with other trains.
To tackle this problem we had to check if a certain station was visited on which train before marking it as visited
```python
if (current_node, last_train_number) not in visited:
    # ...
```
- Design Decision:
Originally, the code parsed the problem examples and formulated the data dictionary by reading the stations CSV file for every problem instance. This approach resulted in repetitive computations and increased runtime.
To enhance efficiency, a design decision was made to calculate the data dictionary for both the mini-schedule and schedule only once during the program's execution. This design change saved approximately 250 seconds of runtime; from running the entire problems.csv file with its 'mini-schedule' and 'schedule' from `1407.296 seconds` to `1141.979 seconds` , as it eliminated the need to repeatedly process the same data for each problem instance.
By precomputing the data dictionary, the program avoids redundant computations and significantly improves overall execution speed. This optimization contributes to a more streamlined and efficient solution for the given problem set.

- The code segment deals with different cases in calculating the new_cost To handle the 'arrivaltime' cost function. The code distinguishes between the first train, train changes and the continuation of the same train. **In the case of the first train**: it manages the wait time at the station from the specified arrival time until the departure of the very first train, along with computing the travel time between the first two stations. **For train changes**: the code calculates both waiting time from the arrival at one station until the departure of the next train and the travel time associated with changing trains. **In the case of the same train continuing**: the code precisely determines the travel time between the arrival time at the current station and the next if these stations were part of the same train route. Negative values are adjusted for midnight changes resulting in adding a day `24 * 60`.
  
- For 'Stops' cost functions (weight = 1) and 'Distance' cost functions (weight = difference between the next and current stations), the new cost is calculated by adding the weight to the current cost. On the other hand, for the 'price' cost function, the new cost is determined by adding the weight to the current cost in the case of the same train, and adding the weight to the current cost plus 1 in the event of train changes or passing midnight. These computations ensure precise cost determination, addressing diverse scenarios in the train connection problem comprehensively.


- We were to utilise 'NetworkX' for creating and analyzing graphs in our train connection problem solution. NetworkX's default Dijkstra's algorithm implementation streamlined pathfinding.
The `nx.DiGraph` class allowed us to model directed train connections, and `add_edge` efficiently connected adjacent nodes. For finding the shortest path, we employed `nx.shortest_path` with Dijkstra's algorithm.
However, the challenge arose in customizing Dijkstra's algorithm during distance cost function calculations. NetworkX's built-in nature limited adaptability, leading to discrepancies in some distance values. we had to pivot from this approach. Instead, we adopted a custom Dijkstra function `dijkstra_shortest_path`, allowing more flexibility and resolving the issues we encountered.


**SCORE:**
```python
# Total points scored on the 'example-problems.csv'
TOTAL POINTS: 79
```

## Output Format
